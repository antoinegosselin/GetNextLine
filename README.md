# GetNextLine
Project GetNextLine for B1 - Elementary Programming in C II at Epitech 

The goal of this project is to write a function that returns a read line from a file descriptor.

If there are no more lines to return, or if there is an error during the reading, the function will come back NULL.

You must define a macro calledREAD_SIZEin yourget_next_line.hfile, which indicates the amount ofcharacters to be read for each read() call
